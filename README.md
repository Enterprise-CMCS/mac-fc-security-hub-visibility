# Security Hub Visibility

  

## A GitHub Action that syncs Security Hub findings with Jira issues

  

1. Gets all current findings from Security Hub, filtered by the `Severity` of the findings (default is `CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM`)

  

2. Creates Jira issues for findings that do not already have a Jira issue

  

-  **To avoid duplicate issues**, the search criteria use default settings for three primary label identifiers: region label, AWS account ID label, and a label "security-hub" along with any custom label configurations provided (see jira-labels-config for example). Additionally, a comparison of the Jira issue description and finding title is made against the findings list. If there is a title match, the decision is based on the Resources list. 

***Note that modifications or deletions of labels may lead to duplicate issue creation***

- For example, if a Jira ticket T1 already exists for a finding with title T1, and a new finding appears with the same title T1 but a different Resources list, the implementation treats these as distinct, resulting in two tickets with the same title but different resources. 

3. Closes existing Jira issues in the target project if their associated findings are no longer active. For findings with the same title, closure is determined based on the resourcesâ€™ presence. For example, if there are two tickets for finding T2 with different resources, `r1` and `r2`, and `r1` is no longer present, then only the T2 ticket with `r1` will be closed

## Tickets Consolidation
If ticket consolidation is enabled (refer to JIRA_CONSOLIDATE_TICKETS in the input section), a single ticket will be created for findings with the same title but different resources in each run. For example, if two findings titled "T2" are reported in a single run, the resources will be merged, and a single ticket will be created for both findings.

In the next run, if one or more findings under the title "T2" are reported again, these new findings will not be merged with the previous "T2" tickets. Instead, a new ticket will be created for the new "T2" findings, and the resources from this new run will be merged into it.

The closure of consolidated tickets depends on the resolution of all the resources listed in their description. For instance, if we have two "T2" tickets with resource lists [r1, r2] and [r3, r4], the first ticket will remain open until all resources are resolved (i.e., no longer present). If r1 and r3 are resolved, neither of the "T2" tickets will be closed. However, if r2 is also resolved, the first ticket will be closed.
## Tenable Recognition
If Tenable findings are reported under the "Default" product name, this implementation will identify the findings based on the product fields and treat them as if they are under the product name "Tenable."

## Outputs

The action provides the following outputs:

- **updates**: List of URLs of created issues.
- **total**: Count of updates made during the run.
- **created**: Count of newly created issues.
- **closed**: Count of issues closed during the run.
- **jql**: The JQL query used for retrieving new updates.

You can utilize the outputs to extend the security hub functionalities. This is especially useful for real-time updates on your security findings and issue tracking.

For example, You can refer to this [Slack Alert Example](https://github.com/Enterprise-CMCS/mac-fc-security-hub-visibility/blob/v2/.github/workflows/test.yml) for a working implementation of Slack notifications in your Security Hub integration workflow.

If set to false, the description will be updated and a comment will be added indicating the finding has been resolved, but the Jira Issue status will not change. The closure has following modes

  

**Full Transition Handling**

The **Full Transition Handling** feature operates automatically when the `jira-transition-map` is not specified. It helps manage issue resolution by automatically transitioning issues through the workflow towards a final status.

  

### How It Works

  

-  **Automatic Transitioning**: The feature attempts to move the issue to one of the commonly used closing statuses, which are:

  

-  `done`

-  `closed`

-  `close`

-  `complete`

-  `completed`

-  `deploy`

-  `deployed`

  

-  **Stopping Point**: If the workflow does not include any of these closing statuses, the system will transition the issue to the final status in the workflow that is not a reject status.

-  **Reject Statuses**: The system avoids transitioning to statuses that indicate rejection or cancellation, such as:

  

-  `canceled`

-  `backout`

-  `rejected`

-  `cancel`

-  `reject`

-  `block`

-  `blocked`

  

For example If there's a workflow which has following transition rules

![Workflow](image.png)
  

In this example:

  

- If an issue is at the `To-Do` status, the feature will attempt to transition through `Progress` and `Worked`.

- Since `Worked` is the last status before the end of the workflow and does not fall into the reject categories, the transition handling will stop there.

  

This feature ensures that issues are moved efficiently through the workflow towards a completion state, minimizing the need for manual intervention.

**Note**: `If the full transition handling feature does not stop at the desired status, consider specifying the transition map using jira-transition-map variable`

  

### JIRA_TRANSITION_MAP

  

When the `AUTO_CLOSE` feature is enabled, the `TRANSITION_MAP` defines which transitions to execute for statuses that are not terminal. Terminal statuses are those where no further action is needed (often 'Done' or similar).

  

### Overview

  

-  **Purpose**: Automate issue transitions based on the specified path to the closure transition.

-  **Format**: A string of semi-colon separated `status:transition` pairs, where each pair maps a status to its transition.

-  **Case Insensitive**: Statuses and transitions are not case-sensitive

  

### Example

  

Let' say there is a jira workflow with the following transition rules.

**Jira Workflow:**

  

`[In Progress] --To QA--> [In QA] --To Test--> [In Test] -- Complete --> [Done]`

  

_Note: [In Progress] is status of issue and the QA is transition name_

  

**Transition Map:**

`"In Progress:To QA, In QA:To Test, In Test:Complete"`

  

- The map provides transitions for statuses except 'Done', which is terminal.

- The system will follow the map's transitions until it reaches a terminal status or detects a loop.

  

**Guide to Specify Transition Map**

To get jira workflow transition information

  

1.  **View Transition Details**:

  

- Open an issue in Jira and click on the status dropdown menu to see the list of available transitions.

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FgBBdT2XAVqjtGdpx_wZkh30tKoMhFhn=s320?authuser=0)

  

2.  **Define Transition Rules**:

  

- Suppose the current status is "In Progress" with possible transitions to "Validate," "Block," and "Cancel." If you want to automate moving to "Validate," add this rule to your transition map:

`In Progress: Validate`

- To continue the issue's progress through the workflow, include the next transition. For instance, if "Validate" leads to "In Review" and you want to set up a transition to "Approve," use:

`In Progress: Validate; In review: Approve`

  

3.  **Update the Transition Map**:

  

- Add all relevant `status:transition` pairs to ensure the issue moves through the desired states according to your workflow.

  

### Wild Card Transition Support

  

If your Jira workflow allows transitions from many or all statuses to another status (such as "Done"), you can use the `*` wildcard in the transition map to specify this. For example, if your Jira workflow permits transitions from any status to "Done," your transition map should be:

  

```

* : Done

```

  

The wildcard has priority in this integration. This means that when processing transitions, the system will first apply any wildcard rules before considering other specific transitions. So, if you have a wildcard transition and other defined transitions in your map, the wildcard transition will be executed first, and then the system will proceed with the other transitions according to the rules defined.

  

### DRY_RUN

  

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: false**

  

Execute a sync but only log API calls to Jira which would create/modify Jira Issues.

  

### `jira-link-id`

  

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: None**

  

**Description:** This field specifies the Jira link ID to which the newly created issue will be linked. If a value is provided, the issue will be associated with this link ID. If not specified, the issue will remain unlinked.

  

### `jira-link-type`

  

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: 'Relates'**

  

**Description:** Defines the type of relationship between the new issue and the feature issue specified by the `jira-link-id`. The default relationship is 'Relates'. Other types can be used depending on your Jira configuration, such as 'Blocks', 'Is blocked by', or 'Duplicates'.

  

### `include-all-products`

  

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: false**

  

**Description:** A boolean flag that determines whether findings from all products should be included in the sync process. When set to true, the tool will include findings from other products beyond those specified. When false, only findings from the specified products will be processed.

  

### `skip-products`

  

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: None**

  

**Description:** A comma-separated list of product names for which findings should be excluded from the sync. This allows you to omit specific products from the synchronization process.

  

### `jira-link-direction`

  

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: None**

  

**Description:** Specifies the direction of the issue link in Jira, which can be either 'inward' or 'outward'. 'Inward' means the new issue will be linked to the feature issue, while 'outward' means the feature issue will be linked to the new issue.

  

### `jira-labels-config`

  

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: None**

  

**Description:** Specifies a stringified configuration for labels to be applied to the Jira issue. Labels are used to categorize and tag issues, making them easier to search and filter.

Example: `jira-labels-config:` `"[{\"labelField\":\"ProductName\",\"labelPrefix\":\"product\",\"labelDelimiter\":\":\"},{\"labelField\":\"severity\"},{\"labelField\":\"accountId\",\"labelDelimiter\":\":\",\"labelPrefix\":\"account\"},{\"labelField\":\"region\"}]"`

Result of the custom labeling above the labels on the issues created will be: "product:Tenable" "High" "account:abc123" "us-east-1"
  

### `jira-watchers`

  

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: ''**

  

**Description:** Comma separated list of User Emails for Atlassion Jira or User EUA IDs for Enterprise Jira.

  

### `jira-add-labels`

  

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: ''**

  

**Description:** Comma separated list of Labels to be added on newly created issues.


## `jira-consolidate-tickets`

**Required: No**

  

**Default Value: false**

**Description:** a boolean (true/false) to enable/disable the ticket consolidation per run
  

## `test-findings-data`

**Required: No**  

**Default Value: ''**

**Description:** JSON string of raw findings list to test security hub jira sync

## Local Testing

See test-infrastructure/jira-container/README.md for instructions on how to run against local Jira container


## Due Date Automation

Automatically assigns a due date to newly created Jira issues based on the severity of the Security Hub finding.

When a Jira issue is created, the system checks for a severity label (CRITICAL, HIGH, MODERATE, or LOW) and calculates the due date by adding a configurable number of days to the current date. 
The resulting date is formatted as YYYY-MM-DD and added to the duedate field.

**Default Due Dates by Severity**

You can customize these defaults via GitHub Action inputs or environment variables.

| Severity   | Input Name           | Default (Days) |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Critical   | `due-date-critical`  | 15             |
| High       | `due-date-high`      | 30             |
| Moderate   | `due-date-moderate`  | 90             |
| Low        | `due-date-low`       | 365            |

**Configuring the Due Date Field**

By default, the due date is set in the standard Jira `duedate` field. However, you can specify a different field (e.g., a custom field) using the `jira-duedate-field` input.

| Input Name           | Default Value | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `business-duedate` | `duedate`     | The Jira field ID to use for setting the due date (e.g., `customfield_xxxxx`). |

** Examples of GitHub Action inputs: **
-  due-date-critical: 3
-  due-date-high:     6
-  due-date-moderate:   9
-  due-date-low:      12

## How to Find a Custom Field ID in Jira

1. Access Jira Administration
 Ensure you're logged in as a Jira Admin.
 - Go to: Jira Settings â†’ Issues â†’ Custom Fields
2. Locate the Custom Field
 - Use the search bar to find the field you're interested in.
3. Open Field Details
 - Click the three-dot menu next to the field and select Edit Details.
4. Find the Field ID
 - You'll be redirected to a new URL. The custom field ID will appear in the URL, formatted like this:

   `id=<field_id>`
   
 - The field name will be:  customfield_<field_id>

This logic now attempts to fetch due dates from the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) feed when a CVE ID is present.
If found, it uses the CISA due date.
If no CISA due date is found, it falls back to our severity-based default due dates.
