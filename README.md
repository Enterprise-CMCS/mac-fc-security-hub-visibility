# Security Hub Visibility

## A GitHub action that syncs Security Hub findings with Jira issues

1. gets all current findings from Security Hub, filtered by the `Severity` of the findings (default is `CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM`)

2. creates Jira issues for findings that donâ€™t already have one. To avoid creating duplicate issues, the search criteria use the custom label configuration as well as default configuration for three identifying search labels: region, AWS account ID, and "security-hub."

3. closes existing Jira issues in the target project if their underlying findings are longer active

Please see `action.yml` for required and optional inputs, and `test.yml` for an example of how to use this action.

This action is backed by the `macpro-security-hub-sync` NPM package. See https://github.com/Enterprise-CMCS/macpro-security-hub-sync for details.
